              <p>Hi there, I'm Evelyn Ramirez. I want to share a little about myself, my hobbies, and my interests. 
                I had fun choosing the photos to share. Enjoy!</p><br>

                      <p>I graduated from CSULA in 2021 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Originally I didn't know what I wanted to study. 
                        After a semester of pursuing Biology I transferred out and into the computer science department. I enjoyed my time at CSULA and should 
                        I have the chance to choose again I would choose CSULA once more because of the wonderful people whom I met and learned from.</p>

                      <p>I am a member of Delete The Divde (DTD), an initiative lead by the County of Los Angeles to advance digital equity in underserved 
                        communities through partnerships, infrastructure investments, and technology resources that empower residents and small businesses. 
                        Through DTD I was able to apply for their internship program where I provide in-person tech support and assistance at a local LA County library, 
                        participate in large scale community outreach events, and have an opportunity to take part in assignments with multiple division 
                        within the Internal Services Department (ISD).</p>

                      <p>Being raised by a single father who worked a lot to take care of my siblings and I, I spent a lot of time participate 
                        in youth sports. Soccer was the sport that stuck and I spent over 10 years playing in local leagues and in high school. 
                        I made so many amazing friends and my heart aches when I look back at those times now that everyone is busy with their own lives.</p>

                      <p>Post my parents seperation and my mother returning to live in Mexico I had the opportunity to spend my summer breaks from school with her. 
                        Together we visiting multiple cities throughout Mexico on road trips and one day quick trips.</p> <br>
                        <p>I've been on two 3-day road trips from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucus where she resides. Along the way we stopped at cities such as Ensenada, 
                          Guerrero Negro, and Loreto. The views were amazing however, since I have terrible motion sickness and the roads are rough at parts of the route it's pretty tough.</p><br>
                          <p>With my dad, we try to visit his hometown in Jalisco at least once a year. To see my grandparents, play tourists, and have fun during the fiestas in his pueblo. 
                            It's so fun seeing and hanging out with all my family who lives in Mexico and whose who live in the US together. We all get together at my grandparents home and 
                            so people end up having to sleep outside in tents from the lack of space.</p>
