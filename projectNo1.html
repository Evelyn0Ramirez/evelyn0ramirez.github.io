            <h1>Estimate Dashboards</h1> </br>
            <p>As an Intern for Delete the Divide I had the opportunity to work with LA County's Internal Services
                Departments(ISD)
                Enterprise Performance & Accountability(EPA) division where I created dynamic data visualizations for
                various divisions within ISD.</p></br>
            <p>For my very first project with EPA I was tasked with creating a progress tracking and status dashboard
                from estimate data provided by
                Maintenence and Operations(M&O) to uncover insights regarding performance.</p></br>
            <p>*Please note that the data used is intended for internal use only and should not be shared with
                individuals outside the organization
                without prior authorization. As a result, I will refrain from presenting actual results derived from the
                data and instead I will
                concentrate on my overall process in designing and creating the dashboards.*</p> </br>
            <div class="project-process">
                <h4>Objective:</h4>
                <p>In this tracking progress and status analysis the aim is to calculate and report the average age and
                    status of tasks. This is important
                    as we want to gain a comprehensive view of our efficiency so that we can make informed decisions to
                    optomize workflow.</p>
                <h4>Key Metrics and KPIs:</h4>
                <div class="project-column-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Average Age of Complete Estimates</li>
                        <li>Average Age of In Progress Estimates</li>
                        <li># of Closed Estimates</li>
                        <li># of Open Estimates</li>
                        <li>Total Percent Closed</li>
                        <li>Total Percent Open</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h4>Data Collection:</h4>
                <p>The data was provided by M&O through an Excel Spreadsheet. The data was cleaned using Excel's various
                    built-in functions and features. Errors were fixed such as duplicates and missing values using conditional 
                    formatting and functions such as COUNTBLANK() and ISBLANK().</p>
                <h4>Data Connection:</h4>
                <p>Imported the Excel Spreadsheet into Power BI and small scale data transformation was done to verify
                    once more that the data is ready to use. Another seperate Excel Spreadsheet imported into Power BI 
                    was a file containing federal holidays.
                </p>
                <h4>Data Modeling:</h4>
                <div class="project-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a calendar table that contains dates using DAX. The calculation used a self-decided
                            start date and an end date set to the latest present date.</li>
                        <li>Date hierarchy was adjusted to accommodate our desired fiscal year which starts in July as 
                            opposed to the default value January. This allowed us to drill down the hierarchy more accurately 
                            (Year -> Quarter -> Month -> Day).</li>
                        <li>Relationships were created between the calendar table on the date field and the dateEstimateRequestRecieved field of 
                            the estimate data table.</li>
                        <li>Utilized DAX functions to add new columns that calculate the days between two dates using DATEDIFF(), and subsequently 
                            created measures based on these columns. These measures were then used for further calculations incorporating conditional 
                            logic. Specifically, I calculated the duration between a start date and an end date to provide a complete estimate, and 
                            determines the age of an estimate by measuring how many days have passed since the day an estimate request was received 
                            up to today, indicating how long a task has been pending.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="project-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a visual that represents each KPI and metric that I was tasked with. I utilized card and matrix 
                            visuals that were customized using a variety of formatting options.</li>
                        <li>Created a header with ISD's colors and official logo using shapes and the grouped them together in the selection pane. 
                            Grouping these elements ensures easier management and consistent positioning.</li>
                        <li>The layer order was adjusted to guarantee that certain elements would not bocker other elements. For example, 
                            the header would be set as the topmost layer. This enhances the overall visual coherence.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4>Adding Interactivity:</h4>
                <div class="project-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a visual that represents each KPI and metric that I was tasked with. I utilized card and matrix 
                            visuals that were customized using a variety of formatting options.</li>
                        <li>Added filters to certain visuals through the Filters pane. Advance filtering on the visuals for where the calculation Complete Estimate is greater than 0 
                            and for when the field dateestimateassignedforworkcompletion is not blank. We want to soley focus on meaningful data and to avoid misleading 
                            visualizations.</li>
                        <li>Added slicers to dynamically filter data, including options for fiscal year and craft. We can drill down into the year slicer to view data 
                            at the quarter and month levels.</li>
                        <li>Implemented dynamic headers and titles that update based on selections made in the available slicers. This enhances clarity and presentation as it helps users understand 
                            what data they are looking at and demonstrates attention to detail and usability.</li>

                <h4>Review:</h4>
                <p>Daily exchanges of emails and conversations occurred with the full-time team member whom I was shadowing. As I received guidance and learned from 
                    their expertise, I developed my own skills and gained confidence in working on these dashboards independently. It was because of this confidence 
                    that I began to research and implement features that I personally found would elevate the dashboards.</p>
